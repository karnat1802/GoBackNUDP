# GoBackNUDP


Built a reliable Go Back N protocol on top of an unreliable UDP. Used C++ socket programming for client and server programs. Mininet virtual machine was used to mimic a lossy channel. Used sequence and acknowledgment numbers for reliability along with concepts of SYN and FIN bits for connection set up and connection teardown between client and server.
